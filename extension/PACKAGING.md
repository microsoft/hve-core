## Extension Configuration

### Extension Kind

The extension is configured with `"extensionKind": ["workspace", "ui"]` in `package.json` to support multiple execution contexts:

* **Workspace mode**: Extension runs in the workspace (remote) extension host. In this mode, the extension accesses its bundled files from the extension installation directory in the remote/workspace context (for example, the packaged `.github/` and `scripts/dev-tools/` folders).
* **UI mode**: Extension runs in the UI extension host on the user's local machine and accesses the same bundled extension files from the local installation directory.

Access to files in the user's project workspace always uses the standard VS Code workspace APIs and is independent of the extension kind. Both modes use the same packaged extension assets and differ only in execution context (local UI versus remote/workspace). This bundling approach ensures GitHub Copilot can reliably access instruction files and scripts regardless of cross-platform path resolution issues (for example, Windows/WSL environments).

This is a declarative extension: it contributes configuration and file paths, and VS Code (together with the GitHub Copilot extension) resolves those paths based on the selected extension host and the extension installation location; it does not implement any custom runtime fallback mechanism between workspace and bundled files.

## Prerequisites

Install the VS Code Extension Manager CLI:

```bash
npm install -g @vscode/vsce
```

Install the PowerShell-Yaml module (required for Prepare-Extension.ps1):

```powershell
Install-Module -Name PowerShell-Yaml -Scope CurrentUser
```

## Automated CI/CD Workflows

The extension is automatically packaged and published through GitHub Actions:

| Workflow                                  | Trigger           | Purpose                                     |
|-------------------------------------------|-------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| `.github/workflows/extension-package.yml` | Reusable workflow | Packages extension with flexible versioning |
| `.github/workflows/extension-publish.yml` | Release/manual    | Publishes to VS Code Marketplace            |
| `.github/workflows/main.yml`              | Push to main      | Includes extension packaging in CI          |

## Packaging the Extension

### Using the Automated Scripts (Recommended)

#### Step 1: Prepare the Extension

First, update `package.json` with discovered agents, prompts, and instructions:

```bash
# Discover components and update package.json
pwsh ./scripts/extension/Prepare-Extension.ps1

# Or use npm script
npm run extension:prepare
```

The preparation script automatically:

* Discovers and registers all chat agents from `.github/agents/`
* Discovers and registers all prompts from `.github/prompts/`
* Discovers and registers all instruction files from `.github/instructions/`
* Updates `package.json` with discovered components
* Uses existing version from `package.json` (does not modify it)

#### Step 2: Package the Extension

Then package the extension:

```bash
# Package using version from package.json
pwsh ./scripts/extension/Package-Extension.ps1

# Or use npm script
npm run extension:package

# Package with specific version
pwsh ./scripts/extension/Package-Extension.ps1 -Version "1.0.3"

# Package with dev patch number (e.g., 1.0.2-dev.123)
pwsh ./scripts/extension/Package-Extension.ps1 -DevPatchNumber "123"

# Package with version and dev patch number
pwsh ./scripts/extension/Package-Extension.ps1 -Version "1.1.0" -DevPatchNumber "456"
```

The packaging script automatically:

* Uses version from `package.json` (or specified version)
* Optionally appends dev patch number for pre-release builds
* Copies required `.github` directory
* Copies `scripts/dev-tools` directory (developer utilities)
* Packages the extension using `vsce`
* Cleans up temporary files
* Restores original `package.json` version if temporarily modified

### Manual Packaging (Legacy)

If you need to package manually:

```bash
cd extension
rm -rf .github scripts && cp -r ../.github . && mkdir -p scripts && cp -r ../scripts/dev-tools scripts/ && vsce package && rm -rf .github scripts
```

## Publishing the Extension

**Important:** Update version in `extension/package.json` before publishing.

**Setup Personal Access Token (one-time):**

Set your Azure DevOps PAT as an environment variable:

```bash
export VSCE_PAT=your-token-here
```

To get a PAT:

1. Go to <https://dev.azure.com>
2. User settings → Personal access tokens → New Token
3. Set scope to **Marketplace (Manage)**
4. Copy the token

**Publish command:**

```bash
# Publish the packaged extension (replace X.Y.Z with actual version)
vsce publish --packagePath "extension/hve-core-X.Y.Z.vsix"

# Or use the latest .vsix file
VSIX_FILE=$(ls -t extension/hve-core-*.vsix | head -1)
vsce publish --packagePath "$VSIX_FILE"
```

## What Gets Included

The `extension/.vscodeignore` file controls what gets packaged. Currently included:

* `.github/agents/**` - All custom agent definitions
* `.github/prompts/**` - All prompt templates
* `.github/instructions/**` - All instruction files
* `docs/templates/**` - Document templates used by agents (ADR, BRD, Security Plan)
* `scripts/dev-tools/**` - Developer utilities (PR reference generation)
* `package.json` - Extension manifest
* `README.md` - Extension description
* `LICENSE` - License file
* `CHANGELOG.md` - Version history

## Testing Locally

Install the packaged extension locally:

```bash
code --install-extension hve-core-*.vsix
```

## Version Management

### Update Version in `package.json`

1. Manually update version in `extension/package.json`
2. Run `scripts/extension/Prepare-Extension.ps1` to update agents/prompts/instructions
3. Run `scripts/extension/Package-Extension.ps1` to create the `.vsix` file

### Development Builds

For pre-release or CI builds, use the dev patch number:

```bash
# Creates version like 1.0.2-dev.123
pwsh ./scripts/extension/Package-Extension.ps1 -DevPatchNumber "123"
```

This temporarily modifies the version during packaging but restores it afterward.

### Override Version at Package Time

You can override the version without modifying `package.json`:

```bash
# Package as 1.1.0 without updating package.json
pwsh ./scripts/extension/Package-Extension.ps1 -Version "1.1.0"
```

## Pre-Release Channel

The extension supports dual-channel publishing to VS Code Marketplace with separate stable and pre-release tracks.

### EVEN/ODD Versioning Strategy

| Minor Version     | Channel     | Example      | Agent Maturity Included             |
|-------------------|-------------|--------------|-------------------------------------|
| EVEN (0, 2, 4...) | Stable      | 1.0.0, 1.2.0 | `stable` only                       |
| ODD (1, 3, 5...)  | Pre-Release | 1.1.0, 1.3.0 | `stable`, `preview`, `experimental` |

Users can switch between channels in VS Code via the "Switch to Pre-Release Version" button on the extension page.

### Pre-Release Packaging

Package for the pre-release channel with the `-PreRelease` switch:

```bash
# Package for pre-release channel (includes experimental agents)
pwsh ./scripts/extension/Package-Extension.ps1 -Version "1.1.0" -PreRelease

# Prepare with PreRelease channel filtering first
pwsh ./scripts/extension/Prepare-Extension.ps1 -Channel PreRelease
pwsh ./scripts/extension/Package-Extension.ps1 -Version "1.1.0" -PreRelease
```

The `-PreRelease` switch adds `--pre-release` to the vsce command, marking the package for the Marketplace pre-release track.

### Pre-Release Workflow

Use the manual workflow for publishing pre-releases:

1. Go to **Actions** > **Publish Pre-Release Extension**
2. Enter an ODD minor version (e.g., `1.1.0`, `1.3.0`)
3. Optionally enable dry-run to test packaging without publishing
4. Run the workflow

The workflow validates the version is ODD before proceeding.

### Agent Maturity Filtering

When packaging, agents are filtered by their `maturity` frontmatter field:

| Channel    | Included Maturity Levels            |
|------------|-------------------------------------|
| Stable     | `stable`                            |
| PreRelease | `stable`, `preview`, `experimental` |

See [Agent Maturity Levels](../docs/contributing/ai-artifacts-common.md#maturity-field-requirements) for contributor guidance on setting maturity levels.

## Collection-Based Packaging

The extension supports building persona-specific collection packages from a single codebase.

### Available Collections

Collection manifests are defined in `extension/collections/`:

| Collection | Manifest                       | Description                            |
|------------|--------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Full       | `hve-core-all.collection.json` | All artifacts regardless of persona    |
| Developer  | `developer.collection.json`    | Software engineering focused artifacts |

### Persona Template Files

Each persona collection has a corresponding `package.{collection-id}.json` template file in `extension/`. These files contain static metadata (name, display name, description, publisher) for the persona edition. The `contributes` section is empty because `Prepare-Extension.ps1` populates it dynamically at build time.

| Template                 | Collection | Purpose                           |
| ------------------------ | ---------- | --------------------------------- |
| `package.json`           | Full       | Canonical manifest (hve-core-all) |
| `package.developer.json` | Developer  | Developer edition metadata        |

The canonical `extension/package.json` serves double duty: it is both the default build target and the `hve-core-all` template. No separate `package.hve-core-all.json` file exists.

When building a persona collection, `Prepare-Extension.ps1`:

1. Backs up `package.json` to `package.json.bak`
2. Copies the persona template (`package.developer.json`) over `package.json`
3. Generates `contributes` into the copied file
4. Serializes the result as `package.json`

After packaging, `Package-Extension.ps1` restores the canonical `package.json` from backup in its `finally` block.

#### Version Synchronization

Template files contain a `version` field managed by `release-please`. The `release-please-config.json` file includes `extra-files` entries for each template, ensuring versions stay synchronized across all persona templates and the canonical `package.json`.

### Building Collection Packages

To build a specific collection package:

```bash
# Build the full collection (default, no template copy)
pwsh ./scripts/extension/Prepare-Extension.ps1
pwsh ./scripts/extension/Package-Extension.ps1

# Build a persona-specific collection (copies persona template)
pwsh ./scripts/extension/Prepare-Extension.ps1 -Collection extension/collections/developer.collection.json
pwsh ./scripts/extension/Package-Extension.ps1 -Collection extension/collections/developer.collection.json
```

When `-Collection` targets a persona other than `hve-core-all`, the prepare script copies the persona template to `package.json` before generating `contributes`. The packaging script restores the canonical `package.json` after building.

### Inner Dev Loop

For rapid iteration without running the full build pipeline, copy the persona template manually:

```bash
# 1. Copy the developer template
cp extension/package.developer.json extension/package.json

# 2. Run prepare to generate contributes
pwsh ./scripts/extension/Prepare-Extension.ps1 -Collection extension/collections/developer.collection.json

# 3. Inspect the result
cat extension/package.json | python3 -c "import sys,json; d=json.load(sys.stdin); print(d['name'], len(d.get('contributes',{}).get('chatAgents',[])),'agents')"

# 4. Restore canonical package.json
git checkout extension/package.json
```

The template file stays clean. Use `git checkout extension/package.json` to restore the canonical state at any time.

### Collection Resolution

When building a collection, the system:

1. Reads the collection manifest to get the target personas
2. Reads the artifact registry (`.github/ai-artifacts-registry.json`)
3. Includes artifacts where `personas` array contains any of the collection's personas
4. Includes all `hve-core-all` artifacts as the base set
5. Resolves artifact dependencies to ensure completeness

### Testing Collection Builds Locally

To verify artifact inclusion before publishing:

```bash
# 1. Prepare with collection filtering
pwsh ./scripts/extension/Prepare-Extension.ps1 -Collection developer -Verbose

# 2. Check package.json for included artifacts
cat extension/package.json | jq '.contributes.chatAgents'

# 3. Validate the registry
npm run lint:registry

# 4. Build the package (dry run)
pwsh ./scripts/extension/Package-Extension.ps1 -Version "1.0.0-test" -WhatIf
```

### Troubleshooting Collection Builds

**Missing artifacts in collection:**

1. Verify the artifact has a registry entry in `.github/ai-artifacts-registry.json`
2. Check the `personas` array includes the collection's persona or `hve-core-all`
3. Run `npm run lint:registry` to validate registry consistency

**Dependency not included:**

1. Check the parent artifact's `requires` field in the registry
2. Ensure dependent artifacts exist and have valid registry entries
3. Dependencies are included regardless of persona filter

**Validation errors:**

```bash
# Run full registry validation
npm run lint:registry

# Check for orphaned artifacts (in registry but no file)
npm run lint:registry -- --verbose
```

### Collection Manifest Schema

Collection manifests follow this structure:

```json
{
    "$schema": "../../scripts/linting/schemas/collection.schema.json",
    "id": "developer",
    "name": "hve-developer",
    "displayName": "HVE Core - Developer Edition",
    "description": "AI-powered coding agents curated for software engineers",
    "personas": ["developer"]
}
```

| Field         | Required | Description                             |
|---------------|----------|-----------------------------------------|
| `id`          | Yes      | Unique identifier for the collection    |
| `name`        | Yes      | Extension package name                  |
| `displayName` | Yes      | Marketplace display name                |
| `description` | Yes      | Marketplace description text            |
| `personas`    | Yes      | Array of persona identifiers to include |

### Adding New Collections

To create a new persona collection:

1. Create a new manifest in `extension/collections/`:

    ```json
    {
        "$schema": "../../scripts/linting/schemas/collection.schema.json",
        "id": "my-persona",
        "name": "hve-my-persona",
        "displayName": "HVE Core - My Persona Edition",
        "description": "Description of artifacts included for this persona",
        "personas": ["my-persona"]
    }
    ```

2. Add the persona to the registry's `personas` section
3. Tag relevant artifacts with the new persona in the registry
4. Test the build locally with `-Collection my-persona`
5. Submit PR with the new collection manifest

## Notes

* The `.github`, `docs/templates`, and `scripts/dev-tools` folders are temporarily copied during packaging (not permanently stored)
* `LICENSE` and `CHANGELOG.md` are copied from root during packaging and excluded from git
* Only essential extension files are included (agents, prompts, instructions, templates, dev-tools)
* Non-essential files are excluded (workflows, issue templates, agent installer, etc.)
* The root `package.json` contains development scripts for the repository
