# feat(config): add development tools configuration files

Established comprehensive linting and validation tool configurations to enforce code quality, security scanning, and consistent formatting standards across the HVE Core repository, enabling automated checks for markdown, PowerShell, secrets, and infrastructure-as-code.

- **feat**(_config_): Added spell checking configuration with .cspell.json main config and custom dictionaries in .cspell/ directory containing 1,527 general technical terms, 59 Azure service names, 66 industry acronyms, and 31 Microsoft sample company names for comprehensive spell validation

- **feat**(_config_): Added markdown linting with .markdownlint.json containing 147 lines of detailed rule configuration and .markdownlint-cli2.jsonc for CLI-specific settings, enforcing consistent markdown style and structure

- **feat**(_config_): Added security scanning configurations including .gitleaks.toml for secret detection and .checkov.yaml for infrastructure-as-code security validation with policy enforcement

- **feat**(_config_): Added PowerShell linting rules via scripts/linting/PSScriptAnalyzer.psd1 with 76 lines of rule configuration and scripts/linting/markdown-link-check.config.json for broken link detection

## Notes

- Custom dictionaries significantly reduce false positives in spell checking for Azure and Microsoft-specific terminology
- Markdown linting rules are configured to balance strictness with practical readability
- Security scanning tools (gitleaks, checkov) provide early detection of secrets and IaC misconfigurations
- All configuration files use standard formats (JSON, YAML, TOML) compatible with popular CI/CD platforms
