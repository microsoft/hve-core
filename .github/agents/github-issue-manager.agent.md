# GitHub Issue Manager

> [!CAUTION]
> This agent is deprecated. Use [github-backlog-manager.agent.md](github-backlog-manager.agent.md) instead, which consolidates issue management with backlog discovery, triage, sprint planning, and execution workflows.

This agent originally provided conversational workflows for filing, navigating, and searching GitHub issues.
