# Artifact Retention Policies Configuration
#
# This file defines retention policies for different types of artifacts generated
# during CI/CD processes to optimize storage costs while maintaining compliance
# and debugging capabilities.

# Default retention for most build artifacts

  # Build outputs and container images

  # Security scan results and reports
  security_reports:
    retention_days: 90  # Longer retention for compliance
    description: "Security scan results, SARIF reports, and gate enforcement results"
    compression_level: 9  # Maximum compression for storage efficiency

  # Temporary/intermediate artifacts
  intermediate:
    retention_days: 7
