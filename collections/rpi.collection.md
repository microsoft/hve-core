Complete complex tasks through a structured five-phase workflow: Research, Plan, Implement, Review, and Discover. The RPI workflow dispatches specialized agents that collaborate autonomously to deliver well-researched, planned, and validated implementations.

This collection includes agents for:

- **RPI Agent** — Autonomous orchestrator that drives the full five-phase workflow
- **Task Researcher** — Gathers context, discovers patterns, and produces research documents
- **Task Planner** — Creates detailed implementation plans from research findings
- **Task Implementor** — Executes plans with progressive tracking and change records
- **Task Reviewer** — Validates implementations against plans and project conventions
