Coaching identity, quality constraints, and methodology instructions for AI-enhanced design thinking across nine methods. The collection supports the HVE Design Thinking pyramid structure spanning Problem, Solution, and Implementation spaces.

This collection includes instructions for:

- **DT Coaching Identity** — Defines the coach's interaction philosophy (Think, Speak, Empower), progressive hint engine, psychological safety patterns, and hat-switching framework for consistent behavior across all nine methods
- **DT Method Sequencing** — Governs the nine-method sequence across three spaces, space boundary transition protocols with readiness signals, non-linear iteration patterns, method routing logic, and coaching state tracking
