**Discover your strengths, identify growth areas, and get personalized kata recommendations for your AI-assisted engineering journey.**

## Introduction

This focused skill assessment helps you understand your current capabilities across five critical areas of modern AI-assisted engineering. Use your results to select the most appropriate katas and create a personalized learning path that matches your experience level and professional goals.

### Assessment Philosophy

**This assessment is designed to support your growth, not judge your current abilities.** Every expert was once a beginner, and every skill level represents a valid point in the learning journey. Whether you're just starting out or have years of experience, this assessment will help you identify the next steps in your professional development.

### Key Principles

**Growth-Oriented**: This assessment focuses on where you're headed, not where you've been. Every question is an opportunity to reflect on your learning journey and identify areas for development.

**No Wrong Answers**: Your honest responses help create the most effective learning path for you. There's no penalty for being a beginner in any area - everyone starts somewhere.

**Learning-Focused**: The goal is to match you with katas and learning experiences that will challenge you appropriately while building your confidence and competence.

**Inclusive by Design**: This assessment recognizes that people come to AI-assisted engineering from diverse backgrounds and with varying levels of experience across different areas.
