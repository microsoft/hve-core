Great software starts before the first line of code. Design thinking in HVE Core follows a structured workflow — explore, specify, clarify, architect — that transforms vague ideas into well-defined implementation plans.

This approach uses AI as a thought partner throughout the planning process, helping you identify ambiguities, explore alternatives, and build confidence before committing to implementation.

:::tip
The planning workflow follows a numbered sequence: `/plan-1a-explore` → `/plan-1b-specify` → `/plan-2-clarify` → `/plan-3-architect`. Each step builds on the previous one.
