HVE Core provides structured workflows that guide AI assistance through complex development tasks. Each workflow combines agents, prompts, and instructions into a cohesive process.

## Available Workflows

### Research, Plan, Implement (RPI)

The RPI workflow is the primary development cycle in HVE Core. It structures work into three phases with dedicated tooling for each:

1. **Research**: Gather context, analyze requirements, and understand existing code
2. **Plan**: Create specifications, architecture decisions, and implementation plans
3. **Implement**: Execute the plan with AI assistance, track progress, and review changes

### Backlog Management

HVE Core includes workflows for GitHub and Azure DevOps backlog operations:

- Issue discovery and triage
- Sprint planning
- Work item creation from requirements documents

### Pull Request Workflows

Streamline the PR lifecycle with automated description generation, reviewer identification, and work item linking.
