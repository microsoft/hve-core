Instructions are coding guidelines that GitHub Copilot follows automatically when you edit matching files. Skills are self-contained packages that bundle documentation with executable scripts for specific tasks.

Together, they form the foundation of consistent, high-quality AI-assisted development — ensuring that every suggestion Copilot makes aligns with your team's conventions and best practices.

:::note
Instructions use `.instructions.md` files with `applyTo` glob patterns. When you edit a Python file, any instruction with `applyTo: "**/*.py"` is automatically applied.
