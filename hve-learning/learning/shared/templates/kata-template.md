CHECKBOX STRUCTURE GUIDANCE FOR CONTENT GENERATION:

✅ DO - Use flat checkbox structure:
- [ ] Complete step 1
- [ ] Complete step 2
- [ ] Verify result

❌ DON'T - Nest content under checkboxes (causes CSS strikethrough issues):
- [ ] Setup validation:
  - Nested bullet (causes CSS issues)

Instead use:
